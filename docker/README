The Dockerfiles and run.sh scripts under aesm and sample enable building
and running the AESM and/or SampleEnclave in Docker container(s).  The
containers communicate over the AESM's socket by mounting the directory
containing AESM.socket into all containers.  If the AESMD is running on
the host, then /var/run/aesmd on the host is mounted to /var/run/aesmd
in the SampleEnclave container.  If the AESM is running in a container,
then /tmp/aesmd is mounted into both the AESM and SampleEnclave containers.

A Docker Compose file and run script is also provided to run the AESM and
SampleEnclave in containers using a single command.
